# A-Grading-System-for-Evaluating-Geospatial-Entity-Connectivity-
This project develops a grading system to evaluate connectivity among geospatial entities extracted from texts. Two versions are proposed: one using co-occurrences and semantic similarity, and another adding geodesic distance. Both are tested with six machine learning algorithms, and results highlight differences in performance.
